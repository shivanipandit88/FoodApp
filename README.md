## Public URL to the application:
https://main.d30i7ibo5hjmbm.amplifyapp.com/
Test account credentials:
Username: shivanipandit88
Password: user1234

## URL to GitHub :
https://github.com/shivanipandit88/FoodApp


    
## Pre-requisites
```
Install npm
Install and configure amplify CLI
Clone this git repo using amplify
Project Set-up
amplify init --app https://github.com/shivanipandit88/FoodApp will initialize locally.

amplify push will then create the following resources in the AWS cloud:

S3 buckets (hosting the frontend + for prescription upload/download)
AppSync (for GraphQL API between frontend and database)
Cloudfront distribution (for frontend distribution)
DynamoDB (for database storage)
Lambda (for authorization of the user at the time of signup)
```

## Local configuration
How to set up and run project locally:
```
git clone https://github.com/shivanipandit88/FoodApp
cd FoodApp
npm init
npm start
The local Host should run on http://localhost:3000 
```

 ## Architecture Diagram:
   This project frontend is created using ReactApplication while the backend is managed using AWS Amplify Services.

## Individual contribution breakdown :

## Shivani Pandit : 
```
Step 1: Start with getting introduced with AWS Amplify. Set up the Amplify CLI on my local system with an AWS IAM user and deployed a basic React Application
Step 2: Set up Git repository with Amplify CI/CD
Step 3: Implemented Cognito for User Registration and Login with  verification code sent to their email address. 
Step 4: Started working on the UI in React using Bootstrap, HTML and CSS
Step 5: Added APIs to Amplify and generate database tables in AWS DynamoDB. Using those APIs connected the UI to the backend
Step 6: Initially started with Registering a Restaurant to deliver food. 
Step 7: Populate the Restaurant Table on the homepage for the user to view the options to choose from.
Step 8: Add Menu Option for the newly registered restaurants.
